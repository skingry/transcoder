How to:

Run the `queue` command specifying where the media you want to transcode is.

Example:

```
./queue "/path/to/my/media"
```

After queuing all the files you want to transcode, process the queue using the command `process`.

Run the `check_resolution` command to list all media that are less than a certain resultion width (e.g. 1080p)
